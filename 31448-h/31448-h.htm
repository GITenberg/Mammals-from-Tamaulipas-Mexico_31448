<h2>Mammals from Tamaulipas, Mexico</h2>

<p class="center">By<br /><br />

ROLLIN H. BAKER</p>


<p>Forming the northeastern border of Mexico, Tamaulipas extends
in an elongated, north-south direction from the Temperate into the
Torrid Zone and contains faunal elements from both the Nearctic
and Neotropical regions. The mammals are less known than those
from some of the bordering states; for the most part collecting has
been limited to a few localities, chiefly along the Pan-American
Highway. Accordingly, as a step towards a long-range study of
the mammals of Tamaulipas, the Museum of Natural History of the
University of Kansas acquired from William J. Schaldach, Jr., a
small, but significant, collection of mammals taken in the last
month of 1949 and the first four months of 1950.</p>

<p>Collections were made at several places in the vicinity of Ciudad
Victoria, including localities along the humid, eastern face of the
Sierra Madre Oriental. Many of these specimens were obtained
near camps made west of the village of El Carrizo. This small
community is on the Pan-American highway, 70 kilometers (by
highway) south of Ciudad Victoria. The resulting collections,
which are reported upon here, disclose that several tropical mammals
range farther northward than previously reported. Funds for
financing the field work were made available by a grant from the
Kansas University Endowment Association.</p>


<h3>ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES</h3>

<h4>Didelphis mesamericana mesamericana <span style="font-weight: normal">Oken<br /><br />

Central American Opossum</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Did[elphys] mes-americana</i> Oken, Lehrbuch d. Naturgesch., pt. 3, vol. 2:1152,
1816. (Type from Northern Mexico.)</p>

<p><i>Didelphis mes-americana</i> Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 16:256, August
18, 1902.</p>


<p><i>Specimens examined</i>, 2 as follows: 36 km. N and 10 km. W Ciudad Victoria,
1 km. E El Barretal, on R&iacute;o Purificac&iacute;on, 1; 12 km. N and 4 km. W
Ciudad Victoria, 1.</p></div>


<h4>Philander opossum pallidus <span style="font-weight: normal">(Allen)<br /><br />

Four-eyed Opossum
</span></h4>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Metachirus fuscogriseus pallidus</i> Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 14:215,
July 3, 1901. (Type from Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico.)</p>

<p><i>Philander opossum pallidus</i> Dalquest, Occ. Papers Mus. Zool., Louisiana
State Univ., No. 23:2, July 10, 1950.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Specimens examined</i>, 3 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and
2 km. W El Carrizo.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;These three specimens have proportionately longer
tails than typical <i>P. o. pallidus</i> from central Veracruz; total length
and length of tail of two adult males are 575, 295, and 568, 290 respectively.</p>

<p>This marsupial has been previously unrecorded from Tamaulipas
or from so northward a locality. The four-eyed opossum evidently
ranges northward along the east face of the Sierra Madre Oriental
within the humid division of the Upper Tropical Life-zone. These
animals, all males, were taken in steel traps baited with the bodies
of skinned mice or birds. Sets were made along well-used trails
leading from a densely vegetated arroyo into a corn field through
openings in a fence of roughly piled logs. The elevation of this
locality is approximately 2500 feet.</p>


<h4>Desmodus rotundus murinus <span style="font-weight: normal">Wagner/span<br /><br />

Vampire Bat
</span></h4>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>D[esmodus] murinus</i> Wagner, Schreber's S&auml;ugthiere, Suppl., 1:377, 1840.
(Type from Mexico.)</p>

<p><i>Desmodus rotundus murinus</i> Osgood, Field Mus. Nat. Hist., publ. 155, zool.
ser., 10:63, January 10, 1912.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>, 9 as follows: 12 km. W and 8 km. N Ciudad Victoria,
2500 ft., 3; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 6 km. W of the
[Pan-American] highway [at El Carrizo], 6.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Vampire bats were taken at two caves. At the cave
called "Los Troncones", 12 kilometers west and 8 kilometers north
of Ciudad Victoria, seven bats were shot down; three were saved.
The second cave, south of Ciudad Victoria, was considerably
damper than the first. Vampires were found in a small side chamber;
nine bats were knocked down. No other kinds of bats were
present in either cave.</p>


<h4>Sylvilagus floridanus connectens <span style="font-weight: normal">(Nelson)<br /><br />

Florida Cottontail
</span></h4>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Lepus floridanus connectens</i> Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 17:105,

2 km. W El Carrizo.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<h4>Sciurus aureogaster aureogaster <span style="font-weight: normal">F. Cuvier<br /><br />

Red-bellied Squirrel
</span></h4>
<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Sciurus</i>, by implication] <i>aureogaster</i> F. Cuvier, Hist. nat. mammif&egrave;res, vol.
6, livr. 59, pl. with text, September, 1829. Binomial published at end of work
only, vol. 7, tabl. generale et m&eacute;thodique, p. 4, 1842. (Type from "California"
= eastern Mexico.)</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>, 13 as follows: 43 km. S Ciudad Victoria, 1; 70 km.
[by highway] S Ciudad Victoria, and 6 km. W of [Pan-American] highway [at
El Carrizo], 3; 70 km. [by hwy.] S Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo, 9.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;These colorful squirrels were taken in thick timber
and brush, and locally are referred to as "ardilla pinta" or "ardilla
colorada." One female obtained on January 22 is black. Local
hunters state that these squirrels are most active early in the morning
and late in the afternoon. Two squirrels were seen in copulation
on January 19.</p>


<h4>Sciurus negligens <span style="font-weight: normal">Nelson<br /><br />

Little Gray Squirrel
</span></h4>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Sciurus negligens</i> Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 12:147, June 3, 1898.
(Type from Alta Mira, Tamaulipas, Mexico.)</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>, 17 as follows: 70 km. [by highway] S of Ciudad Victoria
and 6 km. W of the [Pan-American] highway [at El Carrizo], 5; 70 km.
[by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo, 12.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Referred to as "ardilla chica" locally, these squirrels
were most frequently seen in the dense forest of the lower, elevations.
Active both in trees and on the ground, these animals were
reported as being destructive to corn crops. Females taken in January
were lactating.</p>


<h4>Heterogeomys hispidus concavus <span style="font-weight: normal">Nelson and Goldman<br /><br />

Hispid Pocket Gopher
</span></h4>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Heterogeomys hispidus concavus</i> Nelson and Goldman, Proc. Biol. Soc.
Washington, 42:148, March 30, 1929. (Type from Pinal de Amoles, Queretaro,
Mexico.)</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>, 5 as follows: 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria
and 5 km. W El Carrizo, 4; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 2 km.
W El Carrizo, 1.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;These gophers have been compared with specimens
of <i>H. h. hispidus</i> from Veracruz (5 km. N Jalapa and 4 km. WNW
Fortin) and with specimens of <i>H. h. concavus</i> from San Luis Potos&iacute;
(Xilitla and vicinity and 3 mi. NW Pujal); the latter were examined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
through the courtesy of Dr. George H. Lowery, Jr., of the
Museum of Zoology at Louisiana State University. These five
specimens are assigned to <i>H. h. concavus</i> and resemble in every
way this subspecies except: slightly smaller, somewhat darker, and
skull with lambdoidal crest less inclined forward. In the latter
feature, the single skull available seems to resemble most closely
that of <i>H. h. hispidus</i>. Unfortunately, all but one skull, that of a
subadult female, were destroyed in the field.</p>

<p>This is the first known record of this genus in Tamaulipas and
the most northern locality from which specimens have been taken.
At this latitude, the gopher appears to be restricted to the humid
belt on the east face of the Sierra Madre Oriental. These large
gophers were difficult to trap by ordinary means; Schaldach got
two by using large-sized Macabee traps but the others were taken
at night either with the aid of a dog or by natives with slingshots.</p>


<h4>Liomys irroratus texensis <span style="font-weight: normal">Merriam<br /><br />

Spiny Pocket Mouse
</span></h4>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Liomys texensis</i> Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 15:44, March 5,
1902. (Type from Brownsville, Cameron County, Texas.)</p>

<p><i>Liomys irroratus texensis</i> Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 34:59, September 7,
1911.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>, 15 as follows: 7 km. S and 2 km. W San Fernando,
8; 36 km. N and 10 km. W Ciudad Victoria, 1 km. E El Barretal, on R&iacute;o Purificac&iacute;on,
1; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo, 6.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Most of these mice were taken in densely vegetated
fallow fields, where both grass and brush were found. Many of
the mice were captured at their burrow openings, some of which
were found to be plugged and others not plugged.</p>


<h4>Reithrodontomys fulvescens intermedius <span style="font-weight: normal">Allen<br /><br />

Fulvous Harvest Mouse
</span></h4>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Reithrodontomys mexicanus intermedius</i> Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.,

<p><i>Baiomys taylori</i> Mearns, Mamm. Mex. Bound., Bull. 56:381, April 13, 1907.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Specimens examined</i>, 2 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and
2 km. W El Carrizo.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Specimens were captured in runways in dense grass and weeds
at the edge of a corn field.</p>


<h4>Peromyscus leucopus texanus <span style="font-weight: normal">(Woodhouse)<br /><br />

White-footed Mouse
</span></h4>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Hesperomys texana</i> Woodhouse, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia, 6:242,
1853. (Type probably from the vicinity of Mason, Mason County, Texas.)</p>

<p><i>Peromyscus leucopus texanus</i> Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 28:127, April 17,

Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo, 4.</p></div>


<h4>Peromyscus ochraventer <span style="font-weight: normal">new species<br /><br />

Brown-bellied Wood Mouse
</span></h4>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Female, adult, skin and skull; no. 36958, Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat.
Hist.; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 6 km. W of the [Pan-American]
highway [at El Carrizo], Tamaulipas, Mexico; 12 January 1950; obtained
by William J. Schaldach, Jr., original no. 566.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Known only from the type locality; probably found in other localities
along the humid, east face of the Sierra Madre Oriental in Tamaulipas.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size medium (see measurements); upper parts near Ochraceous
Tawny (capitalized color terms after Ridgway, Color Standards and Color
Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912), brighter on sides and duller on back;
cheeks, sides of neck, shoulders and upper forelegs lighter, between Ochraceous
Buff and Ochraceous Orange; eye ring dark; underparts light Cinnamon Buff,
breast patch brighter; ears dusky, sparsely covered with hairs colored like back;
feet white; tail scaly in appearance, indistinctly bicolored with short dark hairs
above and short pale hairs below; skull without beaded or ridged supraorbital
border; rostrum expanded anteriorly with sides almost parallel; teeth with
strongly developed outer accessory cusps on the first and second upper molar
teeth; anteriormost loph (parastyle-protoconule of Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna,
43:11, September 23, 1918) of the first upper molar large, almost as broad as
greatest breadth of tooth.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;<i>Peromyscus ochraventer</i> has been compared with <i>P. difficilis</i>
(specimens from Veracruz), <i>P. boylei</i> (Veracruz), <i>P. banderanus</i> (Guerrero),
<i>P. mexicanus</i> (Veracruz), <i>P. furvus</i> (Veracruz), and <i>P. latirostris</i> (San Luis
Potos&iacute;). From <i>P. difficilis</i>, <i>P. ochraventer</i> differs in having underparts distinctively
brownish, rostrum expanded anteriorly with sides almost parallel,
anteriormost loph of the first upper molar larger, and auditory bulla smaller.
From <i>P. boylei</i>, <i>P. ochraventer</i> differs in having underparts distinctively brownish,
tail less distinctly bicolored, rostrum expanded anteriorly with sides almost
parallel, and anteriormost loph of the first upper molar larger. From <i>P. banderanus</i>,
<i>P. ochraventer</i> differs in having underparts distinctively brownish, tail
less distinctly bicolored, rostrum expanded anteriorly with sides almost parallel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
anteriormost loph of the first upper molar larger, auditory bulla smaller, and
in lacking a beaded or ridged supraorbital border. From <i>P. mexicanus</i>, <i>P.
ochraventer</i> differs in having underparts distinctively brownish, tail not irregularly
blotched with dusky, rostrum expanded anteriorly with sides almost
parallel, anteriormost loph of the first upper molar larger, and in lacking a
beaded or ridged supraorbital border. From <i>P. furvus</i> and <i>P. latirostris</i>, <i>P.
ochraventer</i> differs in being smaller, having underparts distinctively brownish,
tail not irregularly blotched with dusky, rostrum proportionately shorter, and
interpterygoid space relatively narrower.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Peromyscus ochraventer</i> is considered to be a distinct
species showing little evident relationship with other Mexican
<i>Peromyscus</i>. In the shape of the skull, especially the anterior expansion
of the rostrum, <i>P. ochraventer</i> seems to be related to <i>P.
furvus</i> and <i>P. latirostris</i>, a series of the latter being made available
for examination by Dr. George G. Lowery, Jr., of the Museum of
Zoology at Louisiana State University. However, the rostrum of
these two larger species is proportionately longer than the rostrum
of <i>P. ochraventer</i>. In size, coloration and most cranial features,
<i>P. ochraventer</i> resembles <i>P. mexicanus</i>, although the absence, instead
of presence, of a supraorbital bead or ridge, the almost parallel-sided,
instead of more pointed, rostrum and the larger, instead
of smaller, interiormost loph of the first upper molar in <i>P. ochraventer</i>
are well-marked differences. The baculum of <i>P. ochraventer</i>
is much shorter with a proportionately heavier base and shaft than
the baculum of <i>P. mexicanus mexicanus</i> (from Veracruz) and <i>P. m.
saxatilis</i> (from Costa Rica). The geographic range of <i>Peromyscus
ochraventer</i> is not known to meet that of <i>P. mexicanus</i>; the nearest
place to the type locality of <i>P. ochraventer</i> from which <i>P. mexicanus</i>
has been taken is at Xilitla approximately 225 kilometers to the
southward in San Luis Potos&iacute; (Dalquest, Occ. Papers Mus. Zool.,
Louisiana State Univ., No. 28:8, July 10, 1950).</p>

<p>The brown coloring on the underparts is a distinctive feature of
<i>P. ochraventer</i>; in adults this color differs in shade. In some specimens
patches of whitish hair give the tail a splotched appearance.
Eleven of the twenty-eight skulls and lower jaws examined have
bone eroded away from around the cheek-teeth exposing part of
the roots. Most of the fully adult animals have this condition. One
adult female, no. 36959, has the upper third molar on the right side
missing, possibly as a result of bone erosion.</p>

<p>These mice were taken in junglelike forest, in rocks and adjacent
to logs. Schaldach writes that "Their burrows go back under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
large limestone blocks, and each burrow where I caught a mouse
has a pile of excavated earth, like a tiny gopher mound." The
trapping area was at an elevation of approximately 2800 feet on the
steep sides of a small hill on top of which the field camp was situated.
Schaldach indicated that this locality was transitional between
arid tropical and humid tropical conditions. On January 13,
1950, a female taken was lactating and had five recent placental
scars; another taken the same day also had five placental scars.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;Average and extreme measurements of seven adult males
and six adult females of <i>P. ochraventer</i> from the type locality are, respectively,
as follows: Total length, 238.0 (227-249), 236.5 (226-248); length of tail,

Ciudad Victoria and 6 km. W of the [Pan-American] highway [at El Carrizo],
1.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The specimens, all immatures, are slightly darker than
topotypes of <i>O. c. aquaticus</i>, seemingly tending toward the darker
<i>O. c. peragrus</i> Merriam to the southward. These records of occurrence
extend the known range of this subspecies approximately 210
miles to the southward and increase the possibility of continuous
distribution between <i>O. c. aquaticus</i> and <i>O. c. peragrus</i>.</p>

<p>The male obtained south of Ciudad Victoria was taken on January
12, by William J. Shaldach, Jr., 200 yards within the tunnel of a
mine at an elevation of approximately 2600 feet. This was in the
Sierra Gorda, which is a part of the Sierra Madre Oriental.</p>

<p><i>Specimen examined</i>, 1 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 2
km. W El Carrizo.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This immature male is paler than specimens of <i>O. r.
rostratus</i> from the state of Veracruz. This locality extends the
known range of this species northward a distance of approximately
100 miles. Previously it had been recorded from only as far north
as Alta Mira, Tamaulipas (Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 43:54, September
23, 1918). This specimen was trapped on February 16
in a rodent runway in dense grass in a fallow cane field.</p>


<h4>Oryzomys fulvescens engraciae <span style="font-weight: normal">Osgood<br /><br />

</span></h4>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Oryzomys fulvescens engraciae</i> Osgood, Jour. Mamm., 26:300, November
14, 1945. (Type from Hacienda Santa Engracia, northwest of Ciudad Victoria,
Tamaulipas, Mexico.)</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>, 5 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and
2 km. E El Carrizo.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;These specimens are referred to <i>O. f. engraciae</i> on the
basis of their pale color and narrow interorbital space. They were
taken in runways in dense grass in fallow cane fields.</p>


<h4>Sigmodon hispidus toltecus <span style="font-weight: normal">(Saussure)<br /><br />

<p><i>Sigmodon hispidus toltecus</i> Bailey, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 15:110,

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>, 23 as follows: 36 km. N and 10 km. W Ciudad Victoria,
1 km. E El Barretal, on R&iacute;o Purificac&iacute;on, 1; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad
Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo, 22.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Among named kinds of <i>Sigmodon</i> this series most
closely approaches <i>S. h. toltecus</i> to the southward. The specimens
are slightly lighter in color of the upper parts than are examples of
this same subspecies from 8 km. NW of Potrero, Veracruz, but in
other ways are similar. The single specimen from 36 km. N and
10 km. W Ciudad Victoria is a skull only, but seems closest to <i>S. h.
toltecus</i>. As is often the case with collections of <i>Sigmodon</i>, this
series contains mostly immatures.</p>

<p>Cotton rats were found abundantly in cultivated areas. Local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>

<h4>Neotoma angustapalata <span style="font-weight: normal">new species<br /><br />

Tamaulipan Wood Rat
</span></h4>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Male, subadult, skin and skull; No. 36976, Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat.
Hist.; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 6 km. W of the [Pan-American]
highway [at El Carrizo], Tamaulipas, Mexico; 14 January 1950;
obtained by William J. Schaldach, Jr., original no. 578.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Known only from the type locality; probably found in other localities
along the humid, east face of the Sierra Madre Oriental in Tamaulipas.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size large (see measurements); upper parts dusky brown, paler
on sides, individual hairs on middle of back tipped with black or with Light
Pinkish Cinnamon (capitalized color term after Ridgway, Color Standards and
Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912); head grayer especially on
cheeks; underparts dusky (dark bases of white-tipped hairs exposed), hairs on
throat and inguinal region of adult specimen white to base; outside of legs
dusky gray; tail scaly in appearance and sparsely covered with short, blackish
hairs above and short, whitish hairs below; skull with auditory bulla large;
external auditory meatus large; palatine region narrow; sides of interpterygoid
fossa concave and broadly excavated near posterior end of molariform tooth-rows.</p>

<p><i>Comparison.</i>&mdash;<i>Neotoma angustapalata</i> has been compared with <i>N. torquata</i>
(specimens from Veracruz and Puebla), <i>N. navus</i> (Coahuila), <i>N. mexicana</i>
(New Mexico), <i>N. micropus</i> (Tamaulipas), <i>N. albigula</i> (Coahuila), <i>N. ferruginea</i>
(Jalisco), and <i>N. distincta</i> (from published description in Goldman,
N. Amer. Fauna, 31:64, October 19, 1910). <i>Neotoma angustapalata</i> differs
from <i>N. micropus</i> and <i>N. albigula</i> in having a deep, instead of a shallow,
anterointernal reentrant angle on the first upper molar and seems to belong to
the <i>N. mexicana</i> group of wood rats. <i>Neotoma angustapalata</i> differs from <i>N.
navus</i>, <i>N. mexicana</i>, <i>N. torquata</i>, and <i>N. ferruginea</i> in larger size, darker
underparts, tail with sparse, short hairs and scaly appearance, more broadly
concave sides of interpterygoid fossa at posterior end of molariform tooth-rows,
larger external auditory meatus, and narrower palatine breadth. <i>Neotoma
angustapalata</i> differs from the description of <i>N. distincta</i> in having a faintly
bicolored tail, no ochraceous pectoral band, broadly concave sides to interpterygoid
fossa, and narrower palatine breadth.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Neotoma angustapalata</i> is represented by two specimens;
the type and another specimen, an adult male, no. 37062,
with skin and broken skull. The description takes into account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
both of these specimens. The most significant characteristics of
<i>N. angustapalata</i> are its scaly-appearing tail with short, sparse hairs,
dusky underparts, broadly concave sides of the interpterygoid fossa
at the posterior end of molariform tooth-rows, and the narrow palatine
breadth. Among named kinds of <i>Neotoma</i>, the newly named
species most closely resembles <i>N. torquata</i> and <i>N. distincta</i>; however,
it is geographically widely separated from these two species.
<i>Neotoma navus</i> of southeastern Coahuila is the only other member
of the <i>N. mexicana</i> group in northeastern Mexico.</p>

<p>These wood rats were taken in rocks and crevices at the base of
a small hill in thick vegetation growing in deep humus. Schaldach
termed the trapping site as "arid tropical tending toward humid
tropical".</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;The subadult, male holotype measures as follows: Total
length, 325; length of tail, 154; length of hind foot, 36; length of ear from
notch, 29; basilar length (of skull), 33.9; zygomatic breadth, 22.1; interorbital
breadth, 5.7; length of nasals, 15.2; length of incisive foramina, 8.7; length of
palatal bridge, 8.5; least breadth of palate between first upper molars, 2.7;
greatest breadth of interpterygoid space, 4.1; alveolar length of upper molariform
tooth-row, 9.6. The adult, male, no. 37062, measures as follows: Total

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
